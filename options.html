    Chrome currently doesn't allow extensions to focus on the address bar. A way to get around this is by using iframes. 
	<br/><br/>
	However, some websites, including all of Reddit, don't allow their content to be loaded through iframes. 
    <br/><br/>
	Select the option below if you would like to use iframes so that the address bar automatically gets focus on opening a new tab.
